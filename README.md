## Third year computing assignment MT (reproducibility).

This project is an analysis of a dataset in the Palmer Penguins package in R. We investigate the variance in body mass between three penguin species, notably Pygoscelis antarcticus (Chinstrap penguins), Pygoscelis papua (Gentoo penguins) and Pygoscelis adeliae (Adelie penguins). This analysis involves data cleaning, plotting and statistical tests. We find that of the three species, the Gentoo species has a larger body mass than the other two species. We open the discussion to whether this is an environmental or evolutionary effect.
